## Binary Search 

Binary search is a fairly popular algorithm used to find a number in a series of numbers. 


Binary search time complexity: O(log2n)
Binary search space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used. 

The binary search algorithm workds by repeatedly dividing the search range in half based on whether the target number is higher or lower than the midpoint of the current range.  

You want to 
- Initialize two pointers, start and end. 
- Adjust the search range with the two pointers based on the result of the guess.
