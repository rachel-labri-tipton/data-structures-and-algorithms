As a goal in 2025, I want to improve my understanding of basic computer science data structures and algorithms with daily Leetcode problem practice. 

This is meant to be my own resource for studying data structures, but I'm open to others having a look and maybe also using it as a starting point for supplementary resource for personal study. 

In 2024, I started working on the Leetcode 75, a series of problems that focuses on different data structures and algorithms. I'm currently trying to solve the problems in JavaScript and Python. 

## backtracking 

## binary search

## binary search tree

## binary trees

## bit manipulation

## dynamic programming 

## graphs

## hashtables and maps

## intervals 

## linked-lists

## monotonic stacks

## prefix sum

## queues (FIFO)

## sliding window

## stacks (LIFO)

## strings and arrays

## trie

## two pointers
