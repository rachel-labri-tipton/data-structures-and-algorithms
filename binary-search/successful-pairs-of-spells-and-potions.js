Two-Pointer Approach: The code uses a two-pointer approach to find the number of successful pairs.

It iterates through the potions array.
For each potion, it uses a left pointer to find the first spell in the sorted spells array that, when multiplied by the potion, results in a product greater than or equal to success.
This process of moving the left pointer to the right until the condition is met resembles a modified form of binary search, but it's not a classic binary search implementation.
How it could be closer to binary search:

To make the solution closer to a true binary search, we could modify the inner loop to:

Initialize left and right pointers:

left: 0 (start of the spells array)
right: spells.length - 1 (end of the spells array)
Perform binary search:

While left is less than or equal to right:
Calculate mid = (left + right) // 2
If spells[mid] * potions[j] >= success:
Update right = mid - 1 (search in the left half)
Else:
Update left = mid + 1 (search in the right half)
After the loop:

left will now point to the index of the first spell that satisfies the condition.
Calculate the number of successful pairs as spells.length - left.
This modified approach would more closely resemble a standard binary search implementation. However, the original solution, while not strictly binary search, achieves the same goal with a slightly different approach.
