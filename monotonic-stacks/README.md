Monotonic stacks are a good option when a problem involves comparing the size of numeric elements, with their order being relevant.

[This article](https://dev.to/ashutosh049/monotonic-stack-4lkb) offers a good description of monotonic stack problems: 

- **Next Greater Element**: Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. The next greater element is the first element to the right that is larger than the current element.

- **Next Smaller Element**: Similar to the previous problem, but instead, find the next smaller element for each element in the array. The next smaller element is the first element to the right that is smaller than the current element.

-**Nearest Greater Element**: Given an array of integers, find the nearest greater element for each element in the array. The nearest greater element can be either on the left or the right side of the current element.

-**Nearest Smaller Element**: Similar to the previous problem, but instead, find the nearest smaller element for each element in the array. The nearest smaller element can be either on the left or the right side of the current element.

-**Maximum Area of Histogram**: Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the maximum possible area of a rectangle that can be formed within the histogram.

-**Maximum Area of Binary Matrix**: Given a binary matrix (matrix with only 0s and 1s), find the largest rectangular sub-matrix that contains only 1s.

-**Rainwater Trapping**: Given an array representing the heights of bars, where each bar represents a wall, calculate the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars.

Here is a [list](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/monotonic-stack/) of other monotonic stack problems from LeetCode. 

The **key characteristic** of a monotonic stack is that it allows efficient computation of certain types of information, such as the **next greater element**, the **next smaller element**, or the nearest greater or smaller element for each element in a given sequence.

A monotonic stack is a stack where elements are always in sorted order. This can be ascending or descending order. For review, a stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the element added last is the first one to be removed.
